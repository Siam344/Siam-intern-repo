# ✏️ Writing Meaningful Commit Messages

## 🎯 Goal
Learn how to write clear, meaningful commit messages that improve teamwork and make your project history easy to read.

## ✅ Tasks

### 📖 Best Practices
- Keep it short and clear.
- Use present tense: _"Add feature"_ instead of _"Added feature"_.
- Follow the **50/72 rule**: 50 characters for the title, 72 for details.
- Start with a verb (e.g., _"Fix"_, _"Add"_, _"Update"_).

### ⚖️ Good vs. Bad Examples

**🚫 Bad Example:**
```bash
git commit -m "Fixed stuff"

⚠️ Too Much Detail:
git commit -m "Changed homepage layout, added banner, changed button colors, updated navbar, tweaked footer, modified sidebar links, adjusted font sizes"

✅ Good Example:
git commit -m "Improve homepage: new banner & button colors"

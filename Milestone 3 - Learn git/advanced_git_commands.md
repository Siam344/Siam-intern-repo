# ðŸ“Œ Advanced Git Commands & When to Use Them

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal here is to dive into some of Git's more advanced commands â€” the kind of stuff that makes troubleshooting and code management smoother, especially when things get messy. No more sweating over lost commits or figuring out who did what â€” these commands have got it covered.

## âœ… Tasks

### ðŸ“– Research the following Git commands and give them a spin:

- **`git checkout main -- <file>`** â€” Grabs a specific file from the `main` branch without touching anything else. Super handy when one file is broken, but the rest of the code is fine.
  
- **`git cherry-pick <commit>`** â€” Imagine you made a brilliant fix in a feature branch and now want that specific commit in `main` â€” without merging everything else. Thatâ€™s where this comes in.

- **`git log`** â€” Think of this as your projectâ€™s history book. It lets you trace all the changes, who made them, and when. Plus, you can customize the view to make sense of complicated commit trees.

- **`git blame <file>`** â€” Need to know who last touched a specific line of code? This command calls out the culprit (in the best way possible).

### ðŸ§ª Time to Test:

- Modify a file, then bring it back using `checkout` (like a CTRL+Z for just that file).
- Use `cherry-pick` to pluck a single commit from one branch and drop it into another â€” clean and simple.
- Run `git log` and try flags like `--oneline` or `--graph` for a neat visual of your commit history.
- Use `git blame` on a file and see who last edited each line â€” great for when a bug pops up and you need answers.

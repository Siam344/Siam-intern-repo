# 🐞 Debugging with `git bisect`

## 🎯 Goal
`git bisect` is a tool designed to identify the specific commit that introduced a bug in a project. By using a binary search approach, it quickly narrows down the range of commits, saving time and effort during the debugging process.

## ✅ Tasks

- **Understand `git bisect`:**  
  Acts as a guided detective, splitting the commit history to efficiently find where things went wrong.

- **Create a Test Scenario:**  
  1. Make several commits in the test repository.  
  2. Introduce a bug in one of the commits — on purpose this time.  
  3. Use `git bisect` to locate the problematic commit.

- **Experiment with Git:**  
  Test `git bisect` using either the terminal or a Git client to observe how it streamlines the debugging process.

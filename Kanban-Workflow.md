# 🏷️ Agile Workflows & Kanban – Siam

## 🎯 **Goal**
Explore the Kanban methodology to improve task tracking, workflow efficiency, and prevent team overload.

## 📚 **Research & Learn**

### 📋 **How Does a Kanban Board Work?**
- A **Kanban board** is a visual system for managing tasks, helping teams balance workload and avoid bottlenecks.
- Tasks flow from **Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done**.
- It enables **real-time visibility** of who’s doing what and where things might be stuck.

### 🧱 **What Do the Different Columns Represent?**
1. **Backlog:** Ideas and tasks waiting to be worked on.
2. **In Progress:** Actively being worked on.
3. **Blocked:** Tasks that can’t move forward (awaiting input or approvals).
4. **Done:** Completed and reviewed.

💡 **Pro Tip:** You can customize columns to fit specific workflows (e.g., add "QA Review" or "Ready for Release").

### 🔄 **How Do Tasks Move Through the Board?**
- **Pull-based system:** Team members "pull" tasks when they have capacity.
- Tasks move one column at a time—ensuring work flows smoothly.
- **Responsibility:** The assignee moves the task when a stage is completed.

### 🧮 **Benefits of Limiting Work in Progress (WIP):**
- **Reduces multitasking** (which can slow things down).
- **Improves focus**—fewer tasks in progress means better quality output.
- Helps **identify bottlenecks** faster when things pile up in a column.

## 💡 **Reflection**

### 📊 **How Does Kanban Help Manage Priorities & Avoid Overload?**
- By visually limiting WIP, the team is **less likely to get overwhelmed**.
- High-priority tasks are always visible, preventing them from getting buried.
- The clear flow allows for **faster delivery** and fewer “fire-drill” moments.

### 🛠️ **How Can You Improve Your Workflow Using Kanban Principles?**
- **Use WIP limits**: Set max tasks per column (e.g., 3 tasks “In Progress”).
- **Review the board daily** to spot blockers early.
- **Break larger tasks into subtasks** to maintain flow and track progress.

## 🛠️ **Task Completion**

### ✅ **Checked Out the Kanban Board**
- **Observation:** Some tasks were lingering in "In Progress" for too long.
- **Fix:** Introduced a **“Stuck?”** column to flag blocked tasks.

### ✅ **Moved a Task Through the Kanban Process**
- Moved a feature request from **Backlog → In Progress → Done**.  
- Updating task statuses in real time kept everyone in the loop. 🟢

### ✅ **One Way to Improve Task Tracking**
- Implement **automated status updates** (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to reduce manual updates and avoid tasks falling through the cracks.

## 🏆 **Final Thoughts**
The beauty of **Kanban** lies in its simplicity—it creates transparency, reduces overload, and helps teams focus on finishing work rather than juggling too many tasks.

The **visual workflow** makes bottlenecks obvious and encourages constant improvement.  
**Limit your WIP, and watch your productivity skyrocket.** 🚀

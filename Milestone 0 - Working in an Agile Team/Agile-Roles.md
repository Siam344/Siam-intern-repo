## 📚 **Research & Learn**

### 💼 **What Are the Key Roles in an Agile Team?**

1. **👨‍💻 Developers**
   - Responsible for coding, testing, and delivering features.
   - Turn user stories into functional products.

2. **✅ QA (Quality Assurance)**
   - Ensure that features meet quality standards.
   - Perform manual and automated testing to catch bugs early.

3. **📊 Product Manager (PM)**
   - Acts as the voice of the customer.
   - Prioritizes features and defines the product roadmap.

4. **📅 Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)**
   - Facilitates Agile ceremonies (stand-ups, retrospectives, etc.).
   - Removes blockers and ensures the team follows Agile principles.

5. **👥 Other Supporting Roles (e.g., Stakeholders, UX Designers, Customer Support)**

   - **UX Designers:** Ensure the product is user-friendly and accessible.
   - **Customer Support:** Provides user feedback that informs future improvements.

### 🔄 **How Do These Roles Collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?**

- **Scrum Teams:**
  - Operate in **time-boxed sprints** (usually 2-4 weeks).
  - Regular ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Stand-ups, Retrospectives) promote constant alignment.

- **Kanban Teams:**
  - Focus on **continuous delivery** with no set sprint timeframes.
  - Work items are pulled as capacity allows, and WIP limits help maintain focus.

💡 **Key Insight:**  
While Scrum is great for structured projects with clear deadlines, **Kanban** excels in environments needing flexibility and continuous delivery.

## 💡 **Reflection**

### ⚡ **What Is My Role, and How Does It Contribute to the Agile Process?**
As a **Developer**, my core responsibilities include:
- Translating user stories into working code.
- Collaborating closely with the **QA** team to ensure high-quality releases.
- Participating in Agile ceremonies to align with the broader team.

But it’s not just about writing code—my role also involves:
- Offering technical insights during planning sessions.
- Proactively flagging blockers to the Agile PM.
- Suggesting process improvements during retrospectives.

### 🤝 **How Do My Responsibilities Overlap with Other Roles?**
- **With QA:** Constant communication to squash bugs early.
- **With Product Managers:** Aligning on priorities and understanding user needs.
- **With UX Designers:** Ensuring that technical implementations match the intended user experience.

💡 **Improvement Idea:** Introduce mini demos before features go live to get early feedback from UX and PMs.

## 🛠️ **Task Completion**

### ✅ **Short Description of My Role in the Agile Team**
I’m a Developer who thrives on turning ideas into real, working products. My role isn’t just about coding—it's about **collaborating**, **problem-solving**, and making sure users get features that truly add value.

### ✅ **Other Role I Frequently Collaborate With: QA (Quality Assurance)**
**Why QA?**  
Because quality matters. I work closely with QA to:
- Identify potential issues during development.
- Conduct thorough testing before deployment.
- Reduce post-release bugs (and avoid late-night fire drills 🔥).

**How to Improve Collaboration?**  
- Implement **pair testing sessions** before major releases.  
- Use shared test cases during development to catch bugs sooner.

## 🏆 **Final Thoughts**
Agile teams are like puzzle pieces—each role is vital to the big picture.  
Understanding how we all fit together boosts collaboration, efficiency, and ultimately leads to better products.  

When each role communicates and supports the others, **magic happens**. 💫

# üìñ Agile Principles & Frameworks

## üîç Research & Learn

### ‚úÖ What is **Agile**, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile is a flexible and iterative approach to project management that focuses on delivering value in small, workable increments. Unlike traditional project management (Waterfall), which follows a linear process, Agile allows for frequent changes based on user feedback and evolving requirements. This makes it ideal for dynamic environments where customer needs may shift during the development process.

### ‚úÖ What are the **core values and principles** of Agile?
Agile is built upon four core values from the **Agile Manifesto**:
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

These values are supported by **12 guiding principles**, including:
- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.
- Embracing changing requirements, even late in development.
- Frequent delivery of working software.
- Close collaboration between business stakeholders and developers.
- Sustainable development pace and technical excellence.

### ‚úÖ What are the **differences between Scrum and Kanban**, and when is each used?
**Scrum**:
- Uses time-boxed sprints (usually 2-4 weeks).
- Involves structured roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team.
- Emphasizes sprint planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives.

**Kanban**:
- Visualizes work through a Kanban board with columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Focuses on continuous delivery without set sprints.
- Limits work in progress (WIP) to maintain flow.

**When to use them:**
- **Scrum** is ideal for teams that thrive with clear deadlines and well-defined deliverables.
- **Kanban** works best for continuous workflows, such as support teams or ongoing development.

### ‚úÖ Why does Focus Bear lean towards **Kanban** instead of Scrum?
Focus Bear values continuous improvement and prefers the flexibility that Kanban offers. Since Kanban supports ongoing tasks without the pressure of time-boxed sprints, it better suits teams needing adaptability and a steady flow of work. The WIP limits in Kanban help the team maintain focus and avoid overloading.

## üí° Reflection

### ‚úÖ What do you think are the biggest **benefits and challenges** of Agile?
**Benefits:**
- Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.
- Faster delivery of usable products.
- Encourages collaboration and transparency.

**Challenges:**
- Can be difficult for teams new to Agile practices.
- Requires high levels of communication and coordination.
- Potential for scope creep if not managed properly.

### ‚úÖ How can Agile principles help improve **your role and responsibilities**?
Agile emphasizes continuous feedback, allowing me to quickly identify areas for improvement. By focusing on collaboration and iterative progress, I can deliver value faster while staying aligned with team goals. The flexibility of Agile also helps me adapt to changes without disrupting the overall project flow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### ‚úÖ **Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban**:
- **Scrum** uses sprints with defined roles and time frames, promoting structured planning and reviews.
- **Kanban** uses a visual board and continuous delivery, focusing on flow efficiency and limiting WIP.

### ‚úÖ **Identify one Agile principle** you think will be most useful in your work:
*"Simplicity‚Äîthe art of maximizing the amount of work not done‚Äîis essential."*  
This principle encourages me to focus on what truly matters, reducing unnecessary complexity and improving efficiency.

# AI Usage Guidelines

## Research & Learn

### What AI tools are typically used for your role?
- AI tools like **ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Claude AI** are commonly used for:
  - Generating code snippets.
  - Debugging issues.
  - Writing and editing documentation.
  - Creating test cases.
  - Brainstorming project ideas.

### What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?
**Benefits:**
- Increases productivity by automating repetitive tasks.
- Assists in code generation and problem-solving.
- Provides quick access to information and code examples.

**Risks:**
- Potential leakage of confidential data if entered into public AI systems.
- Inaccurate or biased outputs if not fact-checked.
- Over-reliance can hinder skill development.

### What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?
- Confidential company data.
- Sensitive personal information.
- Proprietary code or business strategies.
- Passwords, API keys, or security tokens.

### How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?
- Cross-reference AI-generated information with official documentation.
- Manually review and test any code snippets before using them.
- Use AI tools as assistants, not as sole sources of truth.

## Reflection

### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
- Use AI for tasks like boilerplate code generation, brainstorming, and quick problem-solving.
- Rely on personal skills for critical tasks, security-related coding, and business-sensitive decisions.

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
- Use AI as a secondary tool, not as the primary decision-maker.
- Continue learning core skills and cross-check AI outputs.
- Encourage problem-solving before turning to AI assistance.

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
- Never input sensitive data into AI platforms.
- Use secure, private AI tools for confidential tasks.
- Regularly review AI privacy policies and data handling practices.

## Task

### Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
- **Task:** Writing unit tests for existing code.
- **Result:** AI-generated unit tests saved time but required manual refinement.

### Review the AI-generated output criticallyâ€”did it require editing or fact-checking?
- Yes, the AI-generated tests required minor corrections and better assertions.

### Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.
- **Best Practice:** Always review AI-generated outputs for accuracy and never input sensitive data into AI platforms.

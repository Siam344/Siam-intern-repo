# AI Tools Experience

## Which AI tools did you try?
I tried **ChatGPT** for code-related queries and debugging assistance. I also explored **Claude AI** for an alternative coding assistant experience.

## What worked well? What didnâ€™t?
- **ChatGPT** was excellent at providing detailed explanations, generating code snippets, and helping debug simple problems. It was also helpful in understanding new coding concepts.
- **Claude AI** offered good alternative solutions but sometimes lacked the in-depth technical detail that ChatGPT provided.
- **GitHub Copilot** (if used) provided real-time code suggestions directly in VS Code but sometimes suggested incorrect code snippets.

## When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
AI is most useful when:
- Generating boilerplate code or repetitive code structures.
- Debugging code errors and providing alternative solutions.
- Learning new frameworks or technologies with quick examples.
- Speeding up coding tasks and increasing productivity.

AI is less helpful when working on highly specialized algorithms or when domain-specific knowledge is needed.

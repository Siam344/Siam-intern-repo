# Git Knowledge

## Have you used Git before?
Yes. I have used Git primarily for version control in my projects. It helps track changes, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of my code efficiently. Iâ€™ve used it for cloning repositories, making commits, creating branches, merging code, and pushing changes to GitHub.

## Which Git client did you choose? Why?
I chose the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** because it offers complete control over Git operations and is widely used in professional environments. The command line provides more flexibility, allows the use of advanced Git commands, and integrates seamlessly with VS Code and other development tools. It also helps in understanding Git workflows more deeply compared to GUI-based tools.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
The most interesting thing I learned today was how Git handles conflicts and how the **rebase** command can be used to maintain a clean commit history. I also found it fascinating how Git allows linking remote repositories and managing branches efficiently, making collaboration smooth even in large teams.

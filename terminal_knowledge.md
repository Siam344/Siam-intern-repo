# Terminal Knowledge

## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I chose **PowerShell** as my terminal client. It integrates seamlessly with Windows and provides powerful scripting capabilities. PowerShell supports many advanced features, is pre-installed on Windows, and works well with Git and other command-line tools.

## What customizations (if any) did you make?
I customized PowerShell by:
- Changing the color scheme for better readability.
- Installing **Oh-My-Posh** for a more aesthetic and informative prompt.
- Adding Git branch information directly in the terminal prompt.
- Setting up aliases for frequently used Git commands.

## What was the most useful command you learned today?
The most useful command I learned was:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all

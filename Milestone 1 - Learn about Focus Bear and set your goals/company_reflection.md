# 📖 Company Reflection: Focus Bear

## 🌟 Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
I think Focus Bear was created because **typical productivity apps don’t work for everyone**—especially for people like me with **ADHD**. Most apps just send notifications that are easy to ignore, but Focus Bear actually **guides you through your habits and blocks distractions in real time**.  

For people who struggle with **executive dysfunction, getting started on tasks, or managing hyperfocus**, this is a game-changer. Instead of just reminding you, it **actively keeps you on track**.

## 🔍 What problem is Focus Bear solving?
From what I see, Focus Bear is solving three big problems:  

1. **Getting easily distracted and struggling to start tasks** – It blocks distractions across devices.  
2. **Inconsistent routines** – Instead of just tracking habits, it **helps you complete them in real-time**.  
3. **Hyperfocus without self-care** – It reminds you to **take breaks, drink water, and take care of yourself** while working.  

I personally relate to this a lot. There are days when I get nothing done because I keep getting distracted, and then other days I work for **hours without eating or drinking anything**. Focus Bear looks like something that could **help me create a balance** between productivity and self-care.

## 🎯 Why do you think this mission is important?
Because **traditional productivity tools fail a lot of people**. If staying focused was as easy as setting a reminder, people wouldn’t struggle as much. The reality is, **executive dysfunction, distractions, and hyperfocus make productivity really challenging**.  

What I like about Focus Bear is that it doesn’t just tell you what to do—it **helps you actually do it**. This approach feels **more realistic** for people who struggle with focus and time management.

## 🤝 How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
As someone with **ADHD**, my daily experience is a mix of:  
- **Procrastinating all day because I can’t focus**, OR  
- **Getting hyperfocused and forgetting to eat or take breaks**  

There’s rarely an in-between.  

Focus Bear aligns with what I personally need because it **helps keep me on track** without overwhelming me. The distraction-blocking and guided routines seem like they would **help me balance focus and self-care**, rather than letting me fall into cycles of burnout or avoidance.

## 🧑‍🎓 Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
100% yes. I struggle with:  
- **Getting started on work** because I get easily distracted.  
- **Forgetting deadlines** because I lose track of time.  
- **Hyperfocus mode**, where I work all day and forget to eat.  

Focus Bear could **help me stick to a routine, block distractions, and remind me to take breaks**—which is exactly what I need to be more productive **without completely burning out**.

## 🎓 Do you know someone with ADHD, autism, or executive dysfunction who struggles at university? How might Focus Bear help them?
Honestly, **I am that person**. University has been tough because:  
- I get **distracted easily**, which makes studying take forever.  
- I **forget to take breaks**, which makes burnout worse.  
- I **struggle to stay consistent** with routines and productivity.  

Focus Bear could really help me **stay on track with my uni schedule**, **block distractions**, and **remind me to take breaks when I need them**. I think it could make a huge difference in keeping my studies organized without constantly feeling overwhelmed.

## **Final Thoughts**
Focus Bear isn’t just another productivity app—it actually **understands how ADHD brains work**.  

For me, this could mean:  
✅ **Less procrastination & fewer distractions**  
✅ **Better work-life balance (no more forgetting meals while working!)**  
✅ **More structured, guided routines to help me stay on track**  

I’m excited to see how this tool could fit into my daily routine and **help me be productive without burning out**.

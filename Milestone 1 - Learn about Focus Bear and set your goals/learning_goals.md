# 🌟 What Do You Want to Learn & Contribute?

## 🚀 What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I want to **deepen my understanding of front-end development**, especially with **React** and **JavaScript**. While I have experience with these technologies, I aim to explore them in more depth—writing **cleaner, more efficient code**, refining my **coding style**, and following **best practices** for building scalable applications.

Additionally, I want to **experience working in a real development team**, something that differs from university projects where I mostly worked independently or with a small group. Understanding **how front-end integrates into a larger system** and improving my ability to work collaboratively will be key takeaways.

## 🔍 What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
One area I want to improve is **working on a professional development project outside of a university setting**. University projects are great, but they don’t always reflect the complexity and standards of industry-level development.

I’d like to:  
✅ Learn **how professional teams operate**, from sprint planning to code reviews.  
✅ Improve my ability to **write production-ready code** that is scalable and maintainable.  
✅ Adapt quickly to new libraries and tools, ensuring I can **learn and apply new technologies effectively**.
